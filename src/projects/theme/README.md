Riot Theme Switcher
===================

Observations

* Plunker is very slow on the updates, runs fine in the real world
* Riot does not play well with &lt;head&gt;
* The official spec says <link rel=""> can only go in the head, but it seems to work in body
* Maybe to be legit, the themes could go in the tag and use if or show to expose
* The default also needs to be hard coded in the head to work with ie on initial load
